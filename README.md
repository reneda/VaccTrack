# VaccTrack

## Features

VaccTrack is an Android Application that provides Covid-19 related assistance.


This app uses an [API]('https://cdn-api.co-vin.in/api/v2/') to help users track the vaccines available near them during a time when vaccines are limited and hard to come by.

Another functionality is an expandable list of the common queries and doubts related to the vaccination process. 

It also automates calls to national helplines from within the application
